# GFWPAC

A general PAC (Proxy auto-config) for the Great Firewall.

The shortened URL of the PAC generated by this project is
[https://git.io/gfwpac](https://git.io/gfwpac).

This project supports the following 5 proxies by default (will try in order):

1. `SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1081`
2. `SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1081`
3. `SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1080`
4. `SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1080`
5. `DIRECT`

**It should be noted that the rules used in this project mainly come from the
awesome [GFWList](https://github.com/gfwlist/gfwlist). The latest PAC is
automatically generated and committed to this project when the GFWList is
updated.**
